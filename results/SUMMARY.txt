SUMMARY OF RESULTS:
===================

Note that in all cases below, we assume that all devices are fully defined, 
fully deterministic, fully reversible, always conserve total flux (like a 
planar circuit with a superconducting boundary), and possess flux-negation 
symmetry.  Further, all device functions that are classified have two states
and are non-trivial (states are utilized in a way that matters) and atomic
(can't be broken into two independent devices).


    Flux-Polarized Case:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    This refers to devices with two internal states each having one flux
    quantum but with opposite flux polarities; the two states are of course
    exchanged under flux negation.


        1-port flux-polarized case:
        ---------------------------
        
        There are 2*1*2=4 syndromes, and thus 4! = 24 raw transition functions.
        But only two of them are flux-conserving. And as we already knew, the 
        only non-trivial behavior is the RM cell. (The other behavior is a 
        reflector that neither utilizes nor modifies its internal state.)


        2-port flux-polarized case:
        ---------------------------
        
        There are 2*2*2=8 syndromes, thus 8! = 40,320 raw transition functions.
        Of these, only 96 of them satisfy the flux conservation constraint.
        This then reduces down to 10 nontrivial device functions satisfying all 
        constraints. These sort into 7 equivalence groups with the following
        size distribution:
        
            Group   # of    # of
            Size    Grps.   Fncs.
            =====   =====   =====
              1       4       4
              2       3       6
            -----   -----   -----
            TOTAL:    7      10
        
        
        3-port flux-polarized case:
        ---------------------------
        
        There are 2*3*2=12 syndromes, so 12! = 479,001,600 raw transition func-
        tions.
          * 25,920 of them are flux-conserving device functions.
          * 288 of those device functions are flux-negation symmetric.
          * 245 (all but 43) of those device functions are atomic functional 
            primitives.
          * 219 (all but 26) of those device functions use the state non-tri-
            vially.
        These sort into 39 equivalence groups, distributed as follows:

            Group   # of    # of
            Size    Grps.   Fncs.
            =====   =====   =====
               1       1       1
               2       4       8
               3       6      18
               6      24     144
              12       4      48
            -----   -----   -----
            TOTAL:    39     219


    Flux-Neutral Case:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    This refers to devices with two internal states each having zero net 
    flux, but where the two states are still exchanged under flux negation.
    We analyze the positive-fluxon sector only, since the behavior for the 
    negative-fluxon sector follows from it via flux-negation symmetry.


        1-port flux-neutral case:
        -------------------------

        Here, there are only 2 syndromes, thus only 2 permutations. They are 
        both flux-conserving (since all unary operations on flux-neutral devices 
        are).  However, neither of them uses the state non-trivially (they 
        can't, since there's only 1 port and 1 signal character, so nothing to 
        affect). The two devices are just a wire (trivial) and a pair of reflec-
        tors (non-atomic).


        2-port flux-neutral case:
        -------------------------

        Here, there are 1*2*2 = 4 syndromes, thus 4! = 24 permutations of the
        transition function. All flux-conserving of course. 16 of them use the
        state non-trivially (aren't state-exchange symmetric). And 14 of those
        are atomic functional primitives that change the state dynamically. 
        These sort into 4 equivalence groups with the following size distribu-
        tion:
        
            Group   # of    # of
            Size    Grps.   Fncs.
            =====   =====   =====
              2       3       6
              8       1       8
            -----   -----   -----
            TOTAL:    4      14


        3-port flux-neutral case:
        -------------------------

        Here, there are 1*3*2 = 6 syndromes, so 6! = 720 permutations (all flux-
        conserving).  Of these, 653 are atomic primitives, 627 of those change 
        the state dynamically, and 600 of those use the state non-trivially. As 
        we've known for a while, these 600 sort into 45 equivalence groups like 
        so:
        
            Group   # of    # of
            Size    Grps.   Fncs.
            =====   =====   =====
              2       1        2
              4       1        4
              6       9       54
             12      23      276
             24      11      264
            -----   -----   -----
            TOTAL:   45      600
