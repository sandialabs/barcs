# BARCS
_**Ballistic Asynchronous Reversible Computing with Superconductors**_ -- Tool for functional element enumeration and classification.

## Background

Since late 2016, a research effort has been pursued at Sandia National Laboratories to explore and develop a novel _asynchronous_ model of ballistic reversible computing (ARC or ABRC); this research has been described in a number of papers and talks. We have been exploring possible implementations of ABRC in superconducting circuits; this sub-effort is called **B**allistic **A**synchronous **R**eversible **C**omputing with **S**uperconductors (BARCS).

## Description

This repository contains the source code for (and results from) a Python program called `barc` whose purpose is to enumerate and categorize the possible BARCS functional elements having two internal states and up to three I/O ports. It takes a few hours to run.  Complete output from the program is in the file `RESULTS.txt` and the results are summarized in `SUMMARY.txt`.
